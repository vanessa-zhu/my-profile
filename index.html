			   I am currently in my first year in PGE at EMLV and I love learning new things, traveling, and trying new cuisines. I am learning to do coding through the Le Wagon website, which represents an exciting and very enriching experience for me.

		   <h2><strong>Ballet ðŸ©°</strong></h2>
		   <p>
			   I love <strong>ballet</strong>, I practiced it for 8 years. It helped me to entertain myself, but also to clear my head during stressful moments. Besides that, this sport has brought me a lot of benefit, such as always keeping a certain posture, gaining concentration and coordination. 
			   During my dance career, I was brought to lead a team, and this allowed me to develop my ability to propose ideas in a creative and collaborative context. Therefore, I had to show leadership and that gave rise to an ability to motivate and guide others.

		   <h2><strong>Taekwondo ðŸ¥‹</strong></h2>
		   <p>
			   I like <strong>taekwondo</strong>, I practiced it for 3 years.
			   This combat sport is a very demanding martial art that requires strength, regularity, attention, perseverance and appeals to reflexes. 
			   By learning the different techniques, I was able to manage my stress, gain self-confidence and develop my team spirit.

		   <h2><strong>Fashion ðŸ“¸</strong></h2>
		   <p>
			   I have been passionate about <strong>fashion</strong> since I was young. For me it is a certain art form that allows me to express my personality through creativity. I define myself through my style which is rather classy and dressed. My favorite colors are pink and black, which is why I use them in most of my outfits.
			   Taking the time to take care of yourself makes every day special and adds pep to life.
